This project is to demonstrate how to create a basic Node.js server
using Express Node.js

## Environment variables

You can create your own **.env** file and setup a port number for your
server to run on, or you can choose to ignore and it will run on default
*port* `5000`.

Open the **.env.example** file to see how to set your port value.

## Run server

To run the server, in your terminal or command prompt, run 
`npm start`.
